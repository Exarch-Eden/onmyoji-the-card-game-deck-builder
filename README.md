## Core Features
Details of the web application's core features.

### Deck Building <span style="color: 'orange';">(WIP)</span>
When a Shikigami is selected in the Shikigami Selection interface, their card set is shown (all 8 unique cards of a Shikigami) in the Deck Building interface.

### Shikigami Selection on Expand <span style="color: 'orange';">(WIP)</span>
An expandable container will house all Shikigami released in the game and will change focus to that Shikigami's card set when their respective preview icon is clicked.

### Game Mode and Faction Filter <span style="color: 'orange';">(WIP)</span>
Allows for filtering Shikigami Selection interface with the four factions in the game. Also allows for selection between one of two game modes (Standard and Unrestricted) which will influence the faction filtering system.

### Deck Code Generation <span style="color: 'orange';">(WIP)</span>
Generate a deck code that can be used in the actual game to generate the built deck from the web app.
